# RBDAS
RBDAS (Role-Based Document Accessibility System) is a Flask-based web app that provides secure, role-driven document access. Admins, Editors, and Viewers have different permissions to upload, edit, delete, share, and view documents. The system includes login, role selection, email-based sharing, version control for edits, and a modern Bootstrap UI.
